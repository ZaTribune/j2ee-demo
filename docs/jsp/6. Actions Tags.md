# JSP Action Tags




### jsp:forward
The `jsp:forward` action tag is used to forward the request to
another resource it may be jsp, html or another resource.

`<jsp:forward page="relativeURL | <%= expression %>" />  `

### jsp:include
The `jsp:include` action tag is used to include the content 
of another resource it may be jsp, html or servlet.  
The `jsp include` action tag includes the resource at request time, 
so it is better for dynamic pages because there might be changes in the future.

The `jsp:include` tag can be used to include static as well as dynamic pages.  
It's good for **Code reusability** - We can use a page many times such as 
including header and footer pages in all pages, so it saves a lot of time.  
```html
<jsp:include page="relativeURL | <%= expression %>">
    <jsp:param name="parameter-name" value="parameter-value | <%=expression%>"/>
</jsp:include>
```

### jsp:useBean

```jsp
<jsp:useBean id="obj" class="com.javatpoint.Calculator"/>  
  
<%  
int m=obj.cube(5);  
out.print("cube of 5 is "+m);  
%>  
```

### jsp:setProperty & jsp:getProperty
The setProperty and getProperty action tags are used for developing web application with Java Bean.   
In web development, bean class is mostly used because it is a reusable software component 
that represents data.  
The `jsp:setProperty` action tag sets a property value or values 
in a bean using the setter method.  
Syntax:
1. to set all properties
   ```html
   <jsp:setProperty name="bean" property="*" value="wow" />
   ```
2. if you have to set a specific value in the property
   ```html
   <jsp:setProperty name="bean" property="username" value="wow" />  
   ```
3. to get a property
   ```html
   <jsp:getProperty name="bean" property="username"/>  
   ```
