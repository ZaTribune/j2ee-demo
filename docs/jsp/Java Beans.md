# Java Beans
A JavaBean is a Java class that should follow the following conventions:

1. It should have a `no-arg constructor`.
2. It should be `Serializable`.
3. It should provide `setters & getters` for all its properties.

According to Java white paper, it is a reusable software component. A bean encapsulates many objects into one object so that we can access this object from multiple places. Moreover, it provides easy maintenance.
